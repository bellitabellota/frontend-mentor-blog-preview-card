## My process
This was intended to be a small design exercise to familiarize myself with Bootstrap. Bootstrap seems to be ideal for quickly developing pages without spending a lot of time on design decisions. However, when attempting to replicate an existing design, it does not offer enough flexibility, which is why a hybrid approach was ultimately used for this exercise.

### Built with
- CSS custom properties
- Bootstrap
